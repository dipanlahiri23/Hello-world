This a depisitory of code for my 1st website. All code of this website is written by me and coppied from a YouTube channel called BroCode. As we where we keep on learning new things, new new pages will keep on getting added. 
When for the 1st time we wrtote code, it was written on a white paper. I used to listen the YouTube video and write all the code on paper 
, boot soon I realised that it is a very inefficient process. Then I shifted to a online medium "OneNote",
Now with one note also, I nned to write code mannualy and can't do coppy pest. So, we were in serch of a place where we can save 
all the code we write, and we end up finding github as a best place for it.
Now after using github our learning speed have increased dramatically,
